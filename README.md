# Smart-Supply-Chain-Decisions-AtliQ-Mart-in-FMCG-Sector
This project provides the insights to AtliQ Mart for analysing the supply chain details under FMCG domain over some months in 2022.

## 🧾 Project Overview
AtliQ Mart, a fast-growing FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, is currently operating in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. As part of its strategic growth plan, the company aims to expand into Tier-1 cities over the next two years.

However, recurring service level issues — particularly in delivering customer orders on time and in full — have led to non-renewal of key customer contracts. In response, the Supply Chain Analytics team has developed a Power BI dashboard solution to monitor and improve delivery performance using interactive data visualizations.

## 📝 Problem Satatement
AtliQ Mart is losing key customer contracts due to poor service levels — especially related to:
- Orders not being delivered on time
- Orders not being delivered in full
The management needs a real-time, data-driven solution to monitor and track service level metrics so that timely interventions can be made before expanding to new markets.

## 🔑 Key Metrics
- On-Time Delivery % (OT %):	Percentage of orders delivered on or before the promised date
- In-Full Delivery % (IF %):	Percentage of orders delivered with complete quantities
- On-Time In-Full % (OTIF %):	Percentage of orders delivered both on time and in full
- Line Item Fill Rate (LIFR %):	Percentage of line items delivered completely
- Volume Order Fill Rate (VOFR %):	Percentage of order quantity delivered out of total ordered

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Power BI:	Data modeling, interactive dashboards, DAX calculations
- Excel/CSV:	Data source for simulation
- DAX:	Custom measures and KPIs
- Power Query:	Data transformation and cleaning

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Orders At Glance: Overview of total orders, OT %, IF %, OTIF %, and performance against targets.
- Order Lines At Glance: Breakdown of delivery status across customers and order lines.
- Trends By Metrics: Time series analysis of key KPIs across cities.
- Line Lead Time Analysis: Visualization of delivery delays by category and geography.
- Products At Glance: Top and bottom-performing products based on VOFR and LIFR.
- Service Level Analysis: Heatmaps and scatter plots showing customer-wise service level performance.

## 📈 Insights
- OTIF % is significantly below target (29.02% vs target 65.91%), indicating widespread service failures.
- Coolblue and Lotus Mart have the highest percentage of delayed deliveries (>73% delayed).
- Surat outperforms Ahmedabad and Vadodara in On-Time delivery but has lower In-Full rates.
- Dairy category accounts for the largest share of total quantity ordered but still has fulfillment issues.
- Some products like AM Biscuits 750g and AM Milk 500g have excellent VOFR, while others like AM Tea 250g fall short.
- Significant lead time variation observed across cities and product categories.
